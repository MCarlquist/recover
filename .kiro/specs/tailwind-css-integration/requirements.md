# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds Tailwind CSS utility-first framework and SCSS preprocessing to the existing Jekyll site to enable modern, responsive styling capabilities with both utility classes and custom SCSS styling while maintaining the current Minima theme structure and functionality.

## Glossary

- **Jekyll_Site**: The static site generator application built with Jekyll 4.4.1
- **Tailwind_CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces
- **SCSS**: A CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with variables, nesting, mixins, and other features
- **Minima_Theme**: The default Jekyll theme currently used by the Jekyll_Site
- **Build_Process**: The Jekyll compilation process that generates static files from source
- **CSS_Pipeline**: The system that processes and compiles CSS files during the Build_Process
- **Development_Server**: The local Jekyll server used for development with auto-reload functionality
- **SCSS_Processor**: The system that compiles SCSS files into CSS during the Build_Process

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate Tailwind CSS and SCSS into my Jekyll site, so that I can use utility classes and custom SCSS styling without losing the existing theme functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Build_Process runs, THE Jekyll_Site SHALL compile both Tailwind CSS utilities and SCSS files into the final CSS output
2. WHILE the Development_Server is running, THE Jekyll_Site SHALL automatically rebuild Tailwind CSS and SCSS when source files change
3. THE Jekyll_Site SHALL maintain compatibility with the existing Minima_Theme layouts and components
4. THE Jekyll_Site SHALL include both Tailwind CSS utilities and compiled SCSS in the generated CSS_Pipeline output
5. WHERE custom styling is needed, THE Jekyll_Site SHALL allow both Tailwind utility classes and SCSS custom styles to be used in templates and content files

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Tailwind CSS and SCSS to be properly configured for Jekyll, so that the build process is optimized and only necessary CSS is included in the final output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Jekyll_Site SHALL configure Tailwind CSS to purge unused styles in production builds
2. WHEN building for production, THE Jekyll_Site SHALL generate optimized CSS with only used Tailwind utilities and compiled SCSS
3. THE Jekyll_Site SHALL include Tailwind's base, components, and utilities layers in the correct order within the SCSS_Processor workflow
4. THE Jekyll_Site SHALL configure Tailwind to scan Jekyll template files for class usage
5. THE Jekyll_Site SHALL maintain fast build times during development with both Tailwind CSS and SCSS enabled

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Tailwind CSS and SCSS integration to work seamlessly with Jekyll's existing build system, so that I can use standard Jekyll commands without additional complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `bundle exec jekyll serve`, THE Jekyll_Site SHALL automatically compile both Tailwind CSS and SCSS files
2. WHEN running `bundle exec jekyll build`, THE Jekyll_Site SHALL generate production-ready CSS with Tailwind utilities and compiled SCSS
3. THE Jekyll_Site SHALL integrate both Tailwind CSS and SCSS processing into the existing CSS_Pipeline without breaking current styles
4. THE Jekyll_Site SHALL ensure both Tailwind CSS utilities and SCSS styles are available in all layouts and includes
5. THE Jekyll_Site SHALL maintain the existing file structure and naming conventions while adding SCSS support

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to write custom SCSS styles alongside Tailwind utilities, so that I can create complex styling that combines the power of both approaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Jekyll_Site SHALL support SCSS syntax including variables, nesting, mixins, and functions
2. WHEN SCSS files are modified, THE Jekyll_Site SHALL automatically recompile during development
3. THE Jekyll_Site SHALL allow SCSS files to import and use Tailwind CSS directives and utilities
4. THE Jekyll_Site SHALL process SCSS files through the SCSS_Processor before applying Tailwind CSS transformations
5. WHERE SCSS partials are used, THE Jekyll_Site SHALL support the standard SCSS import system with underscore-prefixed filenames
