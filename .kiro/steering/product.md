# Product Overview

This is a Jekyll-based static site generator project using the default Minima theme. The site appears to be a standard blog/website setup with:

- A home page with blog post listings
- An about page for site information
- Blog posts organized by date in the `_posts` directory
- RSS feed generation via jekyll-feed plugin

The project follows Jekyll's convention-over-configuration approach for creating static websites and blogs.
